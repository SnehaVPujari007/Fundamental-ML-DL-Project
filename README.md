# Titanic Survival Classification

This project uses machine learning to predict the survival of passengers aboard the Titanic based on various features such as age, sex, class, and other attributes. The model is trained on the Titanic dataset available from Kaggle, and different classification algorithms are used to make predictions.

## Overview
The Titanic dataset contains information about passengers on the ill-fated Titanic ship, such as:
- Survived people


The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that predicts whether a passenger survived or not based on these features.

## Prerequisites
Before running the code, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x

Required Python libraries:
- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `scikit-learn`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `xgboost` (optional)

You can install the required dependencies by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

```
## Model Training

The model is trained using the following steps:

### 1. Data Preprocessing
- **Handle Missing Values**: Missing values in features like `Age` are handled by imputing them with the mean or median value.
- **Convert Categorical Variables**: Categorical features like `Sex`, `Embarked`, and `Pclass` are converted into numerical representations using techniques like **one-hot encoding**.
- **Feature Engineering**: New features are created to improve model performance. For example, the `FamilySize` feature is derived by combining `SibSp` (number of siblings/spouses) and `Parch` (number of parents/children aboard).

### 2. Model Selection
Several classification algorithms are tested to find the best model:
- **Logistic Regression**
- **Random Forest**

- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**

Hyperparameter tuning is done using cross-validation to find the optimal settings for each algorithm and improve model performance.

### 3. Model Saving
After training, the best-performing model is saved to disk using `joblib` or `pickle`. This allows the model to be easily loaded and used for future predictions without needing to retrain.

```python
import joblib

# Save the model to disk
joblib.dump(model, 'titanic_survival_model.pkl')

```
